### Full-stack login and registration for our publishing app

<!-- TODO: DESCRIBE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN: The oAuth2, OpenID Connect and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (if not enough page's count) -->


JWT is a security tokens format which is relatively new, but works very well. It's an open standard (RFC 7519) that improves oAuth2 and OpenID Connect in problem of passing claims between parties in web application environment.


After successful login, the JWT's solution provides an object to our front-end application that tell's us about current's user authorization:

```
{"iss":"PublishginAppIssuer","name":"John Doe","admin":true}
```

The iss is an issuer property - in our case it will be our publishing app's backend application. Name of logged user is obvious - John Doe has logged in successfully. The admin property just is saying that an identified user (logged into our backend's app with correct login and password) is an admin ("admin": true flag). You will learn how to use it in that chapter.

Beside what has been said in the above's example, the JWT's response contains also information about subject/claims, signed SHA256's generated token and an expiration date. The important rule here is that you must be sure about the issuer of your token because then you need to trust to the content's provided alongside in the response. It may sounds complicated, but ***it is very simple*** in real life applications.

The important thing is that you ***need*** to keep protected the token generated by JWT - this security's topic will be elaborated later.


The flow is as following:
1) Our client's publishing app request a token from our express' server
2) The publishing backed app's issues a token to the front-end redux's app
3) And after that, each time we fetch data from backend then we check if a user has access to a requested resources on the backend - ***the resource consumes the token***.

In our case the resource is a falcor-router's routes which has close relationship with the backend, but this may work as well in more distributed platforms.

Remember that the JWT tokens are similar to private's keys - you must keep them secure!
