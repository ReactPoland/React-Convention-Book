### Full-stack login and registration for our publishing app

<!-- TODO: DESCRIBE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN: The oAuth2, OpenID Connect and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (if not enough page's count) -->


JWT is a security tokens format which is relatively new, but works very well. It's an open standard (RFC 7519) that improves oAuth2 and OpenID Connect in problem of passing claims between parties in web application environment.

More in practise the flow is as follwoing:
1) the server assigns an encoded JSON object
2) after client's knows it, then it sends that encoded token with every request to the server
3) based on that token, the server knows who is sending a request

It's worth to visit the http://jwt.io/ website and play with it because you can play with it even before you will start working with them:

![screenshot http://jwt.io/](http://test.przeorski.pl/book/101_jwt_io.png)

After successful login, the JWT's solution provides an object to our front-end application that tell's us about current's user authorization:

```
{"iss":"PublishginAppIssuer","name":"John Doe","admin":true}
```

The iss is an issuer property - in our case it will be our publishing app's backend application. Name of logged user is obvious - John Doe has logged in successfully. The admin property just is saying that an identified user (logged into our backend's app with correct login and password) is an admin ("admin": true flag). You will learn how to use it in that chapter.

Beside what has been said in the above's example, the JWT's response contains also information about subject/claims, signed SHA256's generated token and an expiration date. The important rule here is that you must be sure about the issuer of your token because then you need to trust to the content's provided alongside in the response. It may sounds complicated, but ***it is very simple*** in real life applications.

The important thing is that you ***need*** to keep protected the token generated by JWT - this security's topic will be elaborated later.


The flow is as following:
1) Our client's publishing app request a token from our express' server
2) The publishing backed app's issues a token to the front-end redux's app
3) And after that, each time we fetch data from backend then we check if a user has access to a requested resources on the backend - ***the resource consumes the token***.

In our case the resource is a falcor-router's routes which has close relationship with the backend, but this may work as well in more distributed platforms.

Remember that the JWT tokens are similar to private's keys - you must keep them secure!


### Structure of JWT token

1) The header has information that are required on the backend for recognizing what cryptographic operation to do based on that information (metadata, what algorithms & keys are used)

```
{
	"typ": "JWT",
	"alg": "HS256"
}
```

In general, that part is done 100% out of the box for us, so we don't have to care too much about headers while implementing it.


2) The second part are claims provided in the JSON format, as for example:

a) Issuer - so we know who has issued the token
b) Audience - so we know that this token has to be consumed by our application
c) Issue's date - when the token has been created
d) Expiration's date - when the token is expiring so we have to generate a new one
e) Subject - so an app can know which part of the app can use the token (useful in bigger application)

Besides the claims provided above, we can create custom one that are specific definied by the app's creator.

```
{
"iss": "http://theIssuerAddress",
"exp": "1450819372",
"aud": "http://myAppAddress",
"sub": "publishingApp",
"scope": ["read"]
}
```


TODO - review above.

### New MongoDB's users collection

We need create a users collection in our database. The users will have privilages to:
1) Add new articles in our publishing application
2) Edit existing articles in our publishing application
3) Delete articles in our publishing application.


First step is that we need to create a collection.

You can do it from GUI in Robomongo (introduced at the beginning of the book), but we here will use the command line.

First of all we need to create a file called initPubUsers.js:
```
$ [[you are in the root directory of your project]]
$ touch initPubUsers.js
```

then add the content following content to the initPubUsers.js:
```
[
  {
    "username" : "admin",
    "password" : "c5a0df4e293953d6048e78bd9849ec0ddce811f0b29f72564714e474615a7852",
    "firstName" : "Kamil",
    "lastName" : "Przeorski",
    "email" : "kamil@mobilewebpro.pl",
    "role" : "admin",
    "verified" : false,
    "imageUrl" : "http://lorempixel.com/100/100/people/"
  }
]
```

##### Explanation:
The SHA256 string c5a0df4e293953d6048e78bd9849ec0ddce811f0b29f72564714e474615a7852 is a equilavent of a password 123456 with a salt's string equalt to "pubApp".

If you want to generate this salted password hash yourself, then go to:
http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator

and type ***123456pubApp*** on their website so you will get as following:
![sha256 salted password online](http://test.przeorski.pl/book/102_salted_password_sha256.png)


These steps are required only on the beginning, later we need to program a registration form that is salting the password for our own.


##### Importing the initPubUsers.js file into MongoDB
After we have the correct content in our initPubUsers.js then we can run a command line as following in order to import that new pubUsers collection to our database:
```
mongoimport --db local --collection pubUsers --jsonArray initPubUsers.js --host=127.0.0.1
```

and you will get the same terminal's output as we were importing the article in the first chapter similar to this:
```
2009-04-03T11:36:00.566+0200  connected to: 127.0.0.1
2009-04-03T11:36:00.569+0200  imported 1 document
```

#### Working on the login's falcor-route

Now we need to start working with the falcor-router in order to create a new endpoint that will use the jwt library to provide a unique tokens for the client-side app.

The first thing that we need to do is to provide a "secret" on the backend.

Let's create that secret's config file:
```
$ cd server
$ touch configSecret.js
```

Now we need to put a content of this secret:
```
export default {
  'secret': process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'devSecretGoesHere'
}
```
In future we will use enviroment variables on the production server, so this notation ***process.env.JWT_SECRET  || 'devSecretGoesHere'*** means that the enviroment variable of JWT_SECRET doesn't exsit then please use deafult secret's string ('devSecretGoesHere'). At this point we don't need any development enviroment variables.


#### Creating a falcor-router's login (backend)

In order to make our codebase more organized, instead of adding one more route to our ***server/routes.js*** file, we will make a new file called ***routesSession.js*** and in that file we will keep all endpoints related to the current logged user's session:

Make sure you are in the server dir:
```
$ cd server
```

then create a new file:
```
$ touch routesSession.js
```

And put this initial content into the ***routesSession.js*** file:

```
module.exports = [
  { 
    route: ['login'] ,
    call: async (callPath, args) => 
      {
        let { username, password } = args[0];

        let userStatementQuery = {
          $and: [
              { 'username': username },
              { 'password': password }
          ]
        }
  }
];
```

#### Explanation how works the call routes:
Above we have created an initial call login route in the ***routesSession.js*** file. You can find that instead of using 'get' method, we are going to use a 'call' (***call: async (callPath, args) => ***). That is equivalent of POST for old RESTful approach. 

The difference between call and get method in falcor's routes is that we can provide arguments with ***args***. That allows us to get from the client-side the username and the password. 

The plan is that after we receive credentials with this:
```
let { username, password } = args[0];
```

then we will check them against our database with one user admin. A user will need to know that the real plaintext password is ***123456*** in order to get a correct login jwt token.

We also have prepared in this step a ***userStatementQuery*** - this will be used later when querying a database:
```
let userStatementQuery = {
  $and: [
      { 'username': username },
      { 'password': password }
  ]
}
```

#### Separating the DB configs - configMongoose.js

We need to separate DB configs from routes.js:
```
$ touch configMongoose.js
```

and it's new content:
```
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const conf = {
  hostname: process.env.MONGO_HOSTNAME || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.MONGO_PORT || 27017,
  env: process.env.MONGO_ENV || 'local',
};

mongoose.connect(`mongodb://${conf.hostname}:${conf.port}/${conf.env}`);

var articleSchema = {
  articleTitle:String,
  articleContent:String
}

var Article = mongoose.model('Article', articleSchema, 'articles');
```

#### Explanation:
Above we have introduced new env variables as following: MONGO_HOSTNAME, MONGO_PORT, MONGO_ENV. We will use them when preparing a production enviroment. 

The ***`mongodb://${conf.hostname}:${conf.port}/${conf.env}`*** is using templating feature available since EcmaScript6.

Rest of the configMongoose.js config shall be known for you as we introduced it in the chapter 1.

#### Improving the routes.js file
After we have two new files: configMongoose.js and routesSession.js then we have to improve our ***server/routes.js*** file in order to make everything cooperate together.


First step, delete from routes.js the following code:
```
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/local');

var articleSchema = {
  articleTitle:String,
  articleContent:String
}

var Article = mongoose.model('Article', articleSchema, 'articles');
```

and replace it with new:
```
import models from './configMongoose';
import sessionRoutes from './routesSession';
```
