### Mastering React and Node with FalcorJS as a glue for effective data fetching

Let's discuss about React, Node and Falcor more in details.

It's important to understand why we have choosen Falcor in our technical stack. In general, we in our custom software development's company (you can find more at www.MobileWebPro.pl) use Falcor as it has many great advantages for our clients in terms of productivity of developing full-stack Mobile/Web applications. Some of them:

1. The simplicity of the concept

2. Speed-up by 30%+ the development in comparision to RESTful's approach

3. Low learning curve so a developer who learn Falcor's can get effective very quickly

4. Sexy way of data-fetching which is quite mind-blowing


I will keep these 3 points above short and sweet. Later in that chapter you will learn more about potential problems that you may be aware of when using Falcor & Node.

Currently, we have done kind of full-stack starter kit with React+Redux+Falcor+Node+Express+MongoDB. It's not perfect, yet. We will try to make it better in that chapter
