#### Docker and EC2


We have done the all stuff related to the database-as-a-backend with mLab. It's time to prepare our Docker container.

What is Docker? It's a very useful piece of software which is open source and helps you to pack, ship and run any app as a light (in comparision to a virtual machine for example) container. A container's goals  are similar to the Virtual Machines - the big difference is that the Docker was created with software development on the mind in comparision to VMs. The good part is that the Docker's containers are hardware and platform independent so all worries about what you are working will run everywhere are disappearing.
